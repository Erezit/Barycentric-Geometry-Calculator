Welcome to Barycentric Geometry Project!

There you would be able to draw geometry constructions and find informatrion about barycentric coordinates of different objects. 

Project hasn't been finished yet, but now there are:
-simple user's interface;
-possibility to select points and move them, create lines and midpoints from existing objects.

If you want to start project, you can make it form your console or run it from any IDE.
